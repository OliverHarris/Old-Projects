# Project - Garage
I offered to develop a website with a simple interface for them to edit their site. Unfortunately they decided they didn't need 
a website and their old site is currently pending deletion. However! Here are the specifications I set.

## Specifications 
- The editor must be easy to use and not require to know how it works
- Mobile friendly
- Create demo themes
- Clear layouts and easy navigation

## Editor and css
The editor uses *Content tools js* and the css uses *w3 css*. This made the development a lot quicker
