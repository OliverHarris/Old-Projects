# Project - School app
Our school used a bit of paper to sign A level students in and out of the school. Often people would forget or not bother to use this sheet 
because it was too far away. For this reason I developed a concept app that let people sign in and out using their phones

## The idea
- Each person has a username/password
- They can sign out with their reason
- Staff can see if students are in
- Staff can set themselves as away and therefore their lessons are off

## Optional
- Using this server would allow students only to sign in when they are currently on the local network (On the school grounds)
- Each class can set homework for everyone, so if someones misses a class they will be notified
